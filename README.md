## Modules
*zillow_house_process.Rmd:*
	This file processes the housing data obtained from Zillow research and output country level, state level and county level home value time series data and growth rate over time.

*housing_security_data_processing.Rmd:*
	This file processes the housing security survey statistics from the US Census Bureau. I take in all the weekly files in raw Excel format, then cleans the data and consolidate them to one in country level and the other in state level.

*visualization_and_clustering.Rmd:*
	This file contains a part of further data cleaning for the housing security data and conduct k-means clustering on selected data.
  
*Modeling_xianghenaicha.RMD:* 
Run this model to launch the modeling including time series analysis (optional) and regression analysis.
